# Searsh Agent - Streamlit Application

This repository contains a Dockerfile and necessary files to build a Docker image for a Streamlit application. The application is designed to provide a search agent interface for a specific dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- A dataset file (e.g., CSV, JSON) containing the data you want to search.
- A Streamlit application file (e.g., `main.py`) with the search agent logic implemented.
- A `requirements.txt` file listing all the Python packages required by your application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place your dataset file, Streamlit application file (`main.py`), and `requirements.txt` file in the cloned repository directory.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker build -t searsch-agent-image .
```

This command will build a Docker image named `searsch-agent-image` using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

## Running the Docker Container

To run the Docker container, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 searsch-agent-image
```

This command will start a Docker container using the `searsch-agent-image` image and map the container's port 8501 to your local machine's port 8501.

## Accessing the Application

Once the Docker container is running, you can access the Streamlit application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Application Description

The Streamlit application in this repository provides a search agent interface for a specific dataset. The application allows users to input search queries and view the results in a user-friendly format.

To customize the application, you can modify the `main.py` file and update the search logic according to your dataset and requirements. Additionally, you can add more features or modify the existing ones to enhance the user experience.

Remember to update the `requirements.txt` file with any additional Python packages required by your application.

That's it! You now have a Dockerized Streamlit application for your search agent. Happy coding!
